# Mass DM Bot
### Setup
To set up this bot, first download this github repo and extract the zip. You should be left with just a folder containing README.md, massdmbot.py, Start.bat, and some other files that are useless.Keep this somewhere, as we will use this later. Once you have those, go to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers) and press "add application." It should look something like this:

Once you do that, name it and stuff, then do this:

After that, turn on "prescense intent" and "server members intent." Then, click "copy token." Go to massdmbot.py in some kind of code editing software(I suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for beginners because it is easy to use. Then, look for the line named `token = ''` and paste your token in between the '' things. Save your work, and exit the editor.Then, download [Python 3.8](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSSZTT1N39L), open command prompt, and run `pip install discord.py`. After that, go back to your bot, and do this:

Only select "bot" and "administrator.," and nothing else. Click "copy" on the link, and paste it in your browser. Then, invite your friends. I recomment you use some kind of url shortener, such as [bitly](https://bit.ly). Once it is in enough servers, open Start.bat and type .massdm (your msg) in a server where the bot is(or dms) and it will start dming. To check the amount of servers, do .servers. If you get some kind of error, make an issue and report it there.
